# CoffeePaper

A simple command line program to start your day with.

I created this program to learn python3, specifically on how to read and edit files from a python program, and how to pull and format data from online.

*Features:*
- Weather and time data based on user location collected on first launch
- Name and location stored in ini file
- Random fun facts
